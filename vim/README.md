# Vim Configuration:
There is my .vim/ directory. It houses my snippets for
the time being. I am thinking of what else to add to my
snippets. 
**Note**:
I know that there are some plugins for the things that I am
configuring my vim for. Though, I work a lot over ssh and remote
systems. So, having a vimrc that has everything built-in
makes everything light-weight and not complex is much better.
