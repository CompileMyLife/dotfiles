# Welcome to my Configurations and Setup
So far what lies in this repo are:
* Tmux Config
* Vim Config:
  - vim/        Personal Vim Config
  - .vim/       Simple Vim Config
**Note**:
I have used vim for quite a bit, so there could be many things I use.
However, if you are just starting out, I have a simple .vimrc that you
can use to get started with your vim journey. Feel free to reach out for
any questions regarding this. If you wish to share features/plugins 
please do so! :)
