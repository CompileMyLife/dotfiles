# Welcome to my Configurations and Setup
So far what lies in this repo, is my vim config files in the vim folder
##NOTE:
I have used vim for quite a bit, so there could be many things I use.
However, if you are just starting out, I have a simple .vimrc that you
can use to get started with your vim journey. Feel free to reach out for
any questions regarding this. If you wish to share features/plugins 
please do so! :)
