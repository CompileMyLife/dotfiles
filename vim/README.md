# Vim Configurations:
In this folder I have two vimrc configurations
.vimrc and .simple_vimrc
Choose the simple version if you are just getting started.

There is also my .vim/ directory. It houses my snippets for
the time being. I am thinking of what else to add to my
snippets. 
## NOTE:
You should rename it back to .vimrc for convention sake.
I know that there are some plugins for the things that I am
configuring my vim for. Though, I work a lot over ssh and remote
systems. So, having a vimrc that has everything built-in
makes everything light-weight and not complex.
