# Welcome to my Configurations and Setup
#### I have used vim for quite a bit, so there could be many things I use.
#### However, if you are just starting out, I have a simple .vimrc that you
#### can use to get started with you vim journey. Feel free to reach out for
#### any questions regarding this. If you wish to share something cool, please
#### do so!
## So far what lies in this repo, is my vim config files in the vim folder
